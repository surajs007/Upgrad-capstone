FindDefault - Credit Card Fraud Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to build a classification model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with frauds accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions. The primary goal is to create a reliable model for credit card companies to identify and prevent unauthorized transactions.

Project Timeline
The project is expected to be completed within 2 weeks, and the deliverables should be provided in a zip file. The key activities and tasks to be performed in this project are outlined below.

Tasks/Activities
1. Data Collection
Collect the time series data from the provided CSV file.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform Data Quality Check: Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies in the data.
Visualize patterns, relationships, and trends in the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
3. Data Cleaning
Standardize data if necessary.
Handle missing values and outliers.
4. Feature Engineering
Create new features or transform existing features to enhance model performance.
Explore feature selection techniques.
5. Dealing with Imbalanced Data
Implement appropriate methods to balance the highly imbalanced dataset.
6. Train/Test Split
Apply a sampling distribution to find the best split for training and testing data.
7. Model Selection
Choose the most appropriate classification model for the problem.
8. Model Training
Split the data into training and test sets.
Estimate the best model parameters using the training set.
9. Model Validation
Evaluate the model's performance on the test set to estimate its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
Identify and address any issues with the model, such as overfitting.
10. Hyperparameter Tuning/Model Improvement
Implement hyperparameter tuning methods to enhance the model's performance.
